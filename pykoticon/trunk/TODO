============================================================

TODO, in no particular order :

    - Add a way to provide an additional text when using 
      pknotify --ask.
      
    - Don't display anything or even initialize the graphical interface  
      until an incoming connection is received : this will allow
      a single instance to be launched and choose its display
      at connection time for use on terminal servers.
      
    - SSL or other encryption support.
    
    - Fix focus problem reported by some people.
