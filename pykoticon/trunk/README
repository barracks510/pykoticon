====================================================================

PyKotIcon is a cross-platform client-side helper for PyKota.

It is meant to be launched whenever the user logs in, and stay in 
the taskbar (depending on the client operating system) until the 
user closes his session. 
  
Installation :

  * GNU/Linux and similar :
  
    $ cd pykoticon
    $ python setup.py install
    
    Then modify your .xsession file, or the appropriate file depending
    on your desktop environment, to ensure that the pykoticon command
    is launched in the background each time your X Window session
    starts.
    
    NB : `pykoticon --help` will give you hints about the expected
    command line parameters.
    
  * MS Windows :  
  
    Download pykoticon-x.yy.zip from 
    
        http://www.pykota.com/software/pykoticon/download/tarballs/
        
    Unzip it into a directory of its own. I usually unzip it into    
    /var/lib/samba/netlogon/pykoticon/
    
    Modify the PYKOTICON.VBS file to include the list of authorized
    print servers and change other parameters as needed.
    
    Ensure that PYKOTICON.VBS is executed each time an user logs
    in. The easiest way to do this is in STARTUP.CMD :
    
      --- CUT ---
      SET PATH=%PATH%;\\MYSERVER\NETLOGON\PYKOTICON\
      \\MYSERVER\NETLOGON\PYKOTICON\PYKOTICON.VBS 
      --- CUT ---
