====================================================================

PyKotIcon is a cross-platform client-side print quota monitor for PyKota.

It is meant to be launched whenever the user logs in, and stay in 
the taskbar (depending on the client operating system) until the 
user closes his session. 

It's icon represents a green dollar sign when the user is still allowed
to print, and a red dollar sign when he is forbidden to print on at
least one printer.

When the user clicks (or double-clicks, depending on the client operating
system) on the icon, a table is displayed showing how many pages the
user has printed on each printer, as well as if he can still print or not,
and if is PyKota account is limited by a number of credits, the number
of credits remaining in his account is displayed.

INSTALLATION :
--------------

  1 - On a web server :
  
      The first thing to do is to configure a web server to serve
      PyKota's dumpykota.cgi CGI script. The best place to do so
      is on the print server itself, but for performance reasons
      you may prefer installing it elsewhere.
      
      When installing, you have to ensure that the dumpykota.cgi
      script will be able to read PyKota's configuration and to
      access to PyKota's database, whatever it is, as a PyKota
      administrator. Please refer to PyKota's documentaton for
      details on how to do this.
      
      You can protect access to this CGI script with a username
      and password if you want. Please refer to your web server's
      documentation for details on how to do this.
      
  2 - On each client :
  
      Execute (double-click) on PyKotIcon's installation program, 
      and the software will install itself onto the local hard disk.
      
      The installation procedure will ask you for the full URL to
      dumpykota.cgi which should be installed and working on a
      web server, accessible from the current computer. For example
      enter :
      
        http://printserver.example.com/cgi-bin/dumpykota.cgi
        
      Then the insallation procedure will ask you to enter an optional
      username and password, in the case the access to dumpykota.cgi
      is protected. Just leave the fields blank if access is unrestricted,
      else type in the correct username and password.
      
  3 - You can now execute the pykoticon software. A good place to put
      it under MS Windows is in the Startup folder, or in a netlogon
      script. Under GNU/Linux and similar system, you can put a
      command line to pykoticon in your ~/.Xsession file or configure
      your desktop environment to automatically start it when opening
      the session.
