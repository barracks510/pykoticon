====================================================================

PyKotIcon is a cross-platform client-side helper for PyKota.

It is meant to be launched whenever the user logs in, and stay in 
the taskbar (depending on the client operating system) until the 
user closes his session. 

It's icon represents a green dollar sign when the user is still allowed
to print, and a red dollar sign when he is forbidden to print on at
least one printer.
