====================================================================

PyKotIcon is a cross-platform client-side helper for PyKota.

It is meant to be launched whenever the user logs in, and stay in 
the taskbar (depending on the client operating system) until the 
user closes his session. 

It's icon represents a green dollar sign when the user is still allowed
to print, and a red dollar sign when he is forbidden to print on at
least one printer.

INSTALLATION :
--------------

on the client :

  $ python setup.py install
  $ pykoticon pykota_server_ip_address 7654
  
on the pykota server, in pykota.conf, just set :

--- CUT ---
overwrite_jobticket: /home/jerome/pykoticon/tests/test.py $PYKOTAJOBORIGINATINGHOSTNAME 7654
--- CUT ---

NB : here we arbitrarily chose 7654 as the TCP port, please choose 
any unused port for testing. The TCP port on client and server's 
command line MUST be identical, however on the client (pykoticon) 
side, the first parameter to pykoticon MUST be the print server's ip 
address or hostname : this allows PyKotIcon to only accept requests 
coming from your print server. In the future it will be possible to 
do better filtering to allow several print servers for example. 
  
NB2 : You need wxPython for PyKotIcon to work.  
  
NB3 : Don't expect too much yet ! This release is for developpers only.
